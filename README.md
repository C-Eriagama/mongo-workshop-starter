# WDCC MongoDB / Deployments Workshop - Starter project

This is the starter project for the final workshop in the WDCC series, where we will learn about MongoDB, add it to our backend, and then deploy our frontend, backend, and database!

**IMPORTANT: You MUST [FORK](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repo - do NOT just clone the WDCC version, or you will not be able to deploy later!** Make your own personal fork, which you'll be able to push to.

We have created a Gist for this workshop, available at:

- <https://gist.github.com/andrew-meads/f90769e707424a28f0d10c44068afb79>
